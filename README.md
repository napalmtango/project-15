This is a project utilizing react to manipulate several state variables and make changes to output based on changes to these states.

1. The app creates three random numbers, entered as variables through the useState function and displays them on screen.
2. Each number has a checkbox which toggles their states between on and off, the state variable holds the value of the number when on, or false when off.
3. After the user makes their choices for the state of each number, pressing the sum button will display the sum of all numbers in the on state.
